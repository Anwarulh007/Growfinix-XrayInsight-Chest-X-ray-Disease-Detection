# XrayInsight Chest X-ray Disease Detection Dashboard

This project is a simple and clean Streamlit-based dashboard designed to visualize Chest X-ray images along with sample disease prediction data. It provides an intuitive interface that can easily demonstrate the output of a deep-learning pipeline, even if the backend model is running separately.

## 🚀 Features

* 📌 Center-aligned X-ray image display
* 📊 Bar graph showing sample disease-class distribution
* 🧭 Minimal and responsive UI
* 📁 Supports real dataset image rendering
* ⚡ Fast, lightweight, and demo-friendly

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Streamlit**
* **NumPy / Pandas**
* **Matplotlib**

## 📸 Dashboard Preview

* X-ray sample visualization
* Disease scores shown in a stacked bar chart
* Simple section-wise UI layout

## 🎯 Purpose

This dashboard is built primarily for demonstration and presentation purposes, allowing easy visualization of predictions from a CNN model without exposing or running the full backend pipeline in real time.

## 📂 Future Enhancements

* Real-time model inference
* Grad-CAM heatmaps
* MongoDB storage and PDF reporting
* Enhanced UI components
